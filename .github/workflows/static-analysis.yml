Yes, you can extend your GitHub Actions workflow to include a task that checks if your streamlit_app.py file builds successfully. You can do this by adding a new job to the workflow that runs the Streamlit app to ensure there are no syntax errors or other issues that would prevent it from starting.

Here's how you can update your GitHub Actions workflow:
